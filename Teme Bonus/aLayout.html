                            <h2>The North Sea</h2>
                            <p>The North Sea lies between Great Britain, Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. 
                            An epeiric sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the Atlantic Ocean through the English Channel in the south and the 
                            Norwegian Sea in the north.<br/><br/>
                            It is more than 970 kilometres (600 mi) long and 580 kilometres (360 mi) wide, covering 570,000 square kilometres (220,000 sq mi). 
                            It hosts key north European shipping lanes and is a major fishery. The coast is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in 
                            bordering countries, and a rich source of energy resources, including wind and wave power.<br/><br/>                           
                            The North Sea has featured prominently in geopolitical and military affairs, particularly in Northern Europe, 
                            from the Middle Ages to the modern era. It was also important globally through the power northern Europeans projected 
                            worldwide during much of the Middle Ages and into the modern era. The North Sea was the centre of the Vikings' rise. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            The Hanseatic League, the Dutch Republic, and the British each sought to gain command of the North Sea and access to 
                            the world's markets and resources. As Germany's only outlet to the ocean, the North Sea was strategically important 
                            through both World Wars.</p>

                            <h2>Tropical forest</h2>
                            <p><b>Tropical forests (a.k.a. jungle)</b> are forested landscapes in tropical regions: i.e. land areas approximately bounded 
                                by the tropic of Cancer and Capricorn, but possibly affected by other factors such as prevailing winds.
                               <br/><br/>
                                Some tropical forest types are difficult to categorise. While forests in temperate areas are readily categorised on 
                                the basis of tree canopy density, such schemes do not work well in tropical forests. There is no single scheme that 
                                defines what a forest is, in tropical regions or elsewhere. Because of these difficulties, information on the 
                                extent of tropical forests varies between sources. However, tropical forests are extensive, making up just under half
                                 the world's forests. The tropical domain has the largest proportion of the worlds forests (45 percent), followed 
                                 by the boreal, temperate and subtropical domains.
                                 <br/><br/>The original tropical rainforests, which covered the planet's land surface,
                                  were the type of flora that covered Earth. Other canopy forests expanded north-south 
                                  of the equator during the Paleogene epoch, around 40 million years ago, as a result 
                                  of the emergence of drier, cooler climates.
                                 The tropical forest was originally identified as a specific type of biome in 1949.
