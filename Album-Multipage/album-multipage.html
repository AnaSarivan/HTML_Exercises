    JPG - JPEG or “Joint Photographic Expert Group” is the method 
    of compressing data by losing something from digital image. It 
    is the losing compression method for storing and organizing 
    digital images and saves the images with file extension .jpg.

    ICO -ICO is a typical file format in Microsoft Windows for managing
    small computer icons. You can see ICO files in Windows OS various
    sizes and different color depths as well. Moreover, we can scale
    ICO files very easily.
   
    PNG - PNG or “Portable Network Graphic” is a file format for 
    storing digital images but in true colors. it can support the 
    large images without disturbing uniformly colored areas. it can 
    support both lossless and lossy format for editing and storing 
    images. It has file extension .png.

    JPEG vs PNG vs ICO

    No doubt, all JPEG, PNG, ICO are the types of file formats 
    for storing and managing digital images, 
    but their use and file extensions are much different. 
    JPEG can support only lossy compression in contrast to 
    PNG that is suitable for both lossy and lossless format.  
    ICO that is used for supporting small computer icons.
